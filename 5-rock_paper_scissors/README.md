### Breakdown of Logic:

- **User Input**: We prompt the user to select between Rock, Paper, and Scissors by entering `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- **Validation**: We validate the user's input to ensure it's a valid choice. If the user enters anything other than `0`, `1`, or `2`, we print a message that they've lost by entering an invalid number.
- **Computer's Choice**: The computer randomly picks its move using `random.randint(0, 2)`, which will give either `0` (Rock), `1` (Paper), or `2` (Scissors).
- **Game Outcome**:
  - We check the different conditions to decide who wins. This involves comparing the user's choice with the computer's choice and determining the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
  - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
  - We explicitly handle some special cases (e.g., Rock vs. Scissors) and then use the relative size of the choices to handle the remaining cases.

By understanding this breakdown, you should be able to remember the logic and structure more easily! You can also simulate the decision-making process in your head: "If the computer picks this and I pick that, who wins?" This way, the logic becomes intuitive rather than something you have to memorize.
