### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Imports:**
   - We import `turtle` for drawing and interacting with the graphics, `time` for delays, and `random` to randomly place food on the screen.

2. **Setup:**
   - We set the game window properties (size, title, color) and configure the turtle's head and food objects.
   - The snake's head and food are created as separate turtle objects with their own properties such as shape, color, and position.

3. **Movement Functions:**
   - We define functions (`go_up`, `go_down`, `go_right`, `go_left`) to change the snake's movement direction based on user input. The snake cannot directly reverse direction to avoid collisions.

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The main game loop handles screen updates, movement, collision detection, and growing the snake when it eats food.
   - The snake's body segments follow the head by moving in reverse order, with the last segment taking the position of the second-to-last segment, and so on.

5. **Collision Detection:**
   - We check for collisions with the game boundaries, food, and the snake's own body. If the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, the game resets the snake's position and stops its movement.

6. **Keyboard Binding:**
   - Keyboard input is captured using `wn.listen()` and `wn.onkeypress()`. The snake moves based on the player pressing specific keys.

7. **Food Eating Logic:**
   - When the snake

 head reaches the food, a new segment is added to the snake, and the food is moved to a new random location.

8. **Snake Growth and Movement:**
   - When the snake eats the food, a new segment is added to the list `segments`, and each segment follows the one before it, creating the appearance of a growing snake.
