It's common to feel worried about forgetting the steps or details when you're under pressure on the day of the interview or coding test.

However, there are some strategies you can use to improve your memory and retention and to perform better on the day. Let’s break this down into effective techniques:
We are going to be using the TIC-TAC-TOE game to explain these strategies so it makes it easier for you to relate

### 1. **Understand the Code, Don’t Just Memorize It**
   - **Understanding over memorization:** Instead of trying to remember each line of code, focus on understanding **why** you are doing something. For example, know why you're checking for a winner, why input validation is important, and why the AI moves the way it does.
   - **Practice explaining the code:** Pretend you're explaining the code to a beginner. This will solidify your understanding and help you internalize the logic. This is called the **Feynman Technique**, where explaining something helps you understand it better.

### 2. **Practice Regularly**
   - **Consistent repetition:** Set up regular practice sessions. Even practicing for 30 minutes a day can have a huge impact. This way, you’re continually reinforcing the logic and steps in your mind.
   - **Hands-on practice:** Code the project from scratch multiple times. Don’t refer to the notes unless you’re stuck. As you do this repetitively, your muscle memory will improve, and it will become second nature.
   
### 3. **Break Down the Code into Smaller Sections**
   - **Step-by-step breakdown:** Break the entire code into sections: initializing the board, displaying the board, checking for a winner, etc. Memorize and understand each step on its own. For example:
     1. Displaying the board.
     2. Updating a cell.
     3. Checking for a winner.
     4. AI making a move.
   - Once you’re comfortable with each section, put them together.
   
### 4. **Use Mnemonics or Visualization**
   - **Use mnemonics or memory aids:** You can use mnemonic devices to help remember certain processes. For instance, for the steps in checking for a winner, you could create a phrase or acronym that helps you recall the logic.
   - **Visualize the code structure:** Mentally visualize the Tic-Tac-Toe board and the flow of the game. Picture yourself writing the code as you go through each function in your mind. This technique can help with both retention and retrieval.

### 5. **Use Flashcards or Notes**
   - **Create quick reference flashcards:** Write down key concepts or pseudocode on flashcards. For example, one card might have the win combinations; another card might have the steps for validating input.
   - **Use paper notes:** Have a sheet of paper where you summarize the most important steps. Review these notes every day before the interview.

### 6. **Teach Someone Else**
   - **Teaching solidifies knowledge:** Find a friend, colleague, or even just speak out loud to an imaginary person. Teaching someone how to build the game will help you remember better because it forces you to articulate and reinforce the steps.
   
### 7. **Simulate the Interview Day**
   - **Practice in a timed environment:** Simulate the actual interview or test environment. Set a timer, clear your desk, and recreate the conditions of the coding test. This helps reduce anxiety and prepares you for the kind of pressure you’ll experience.
   - **Practice without external help:** Avoid checking notes, looking at tutorials, or using online compilers that give hints. This will help you realize what areas need more attention.

### 8. **Plan for Mistakes**
   - **Plan for errors:** Understand that making mistakes is normal. When you practice, take note of the mistakes you make frequently and focus on those areas. The goal isn’t to code perfectly but to know how to debug when things don’t work as expected.

### 9. **Use Mind Maps**
   - **Create a mind map:** Create a mind map that connects the different parts of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. For example, start with the main loop in the middle, and branch out to “Player Turn,” “AI Turn,” “Check Winner,” etc. This will help you visualize the flow and remember how the functions interconnect.

### 10. **Keep Calm and Manage Stress**
   - **Breathing techniques:** On the day of the test, use breathing exercises to calm your nerves and help you focus. Deep, slow breathing can reduce anxiety and improve concentration.
   - **Positive visualization:** Imagine yourself succeeding. A positive mindset will help you approach the task confidently.

### Example Plan for Retaining Knowledge

Here’s an example of a study plan for the next few days:

- **Day 1**: 
  - Code the entire game from scratch without looking at the solution. 
  - Focus on understanding the main logic (initializing the board, checking for winners, making moves).
  - Take note of any sections you struggle with and review them.

- **Day 2**:
  - Break the game into chunks and code each chunk separately.
  - Explain each section out loud (e.g., how the `is_winner()` function works, how the AI makes a move).
  - Create flashcards for the sections that are hardest for you.

- **Day 3**:
  - Code the game again, this time simulating a real interview (time yourself and work in a distraction-free environment).
  - Review your mistakes and practice debugging.
  
- **Day 4 (Day Before Interview)**:
  - Review your flashcards or summary notes.
  - Visualize yourself coding the game successfully.
  - Do one last practice coding session, focusing on clarity and correctness rather than speed.

### Final Thoughts

You’ve got this! The key to success is preparation. By understanding the logic behind your code, practicing regularly, breaking it down into smaller pieces, and simulating the interview environment, you’ll increase your confidence and be well-prepared for the day. Remember that interviews are not just about getting the code 100% right but also about showing your problem-solving approach and how you handle challenges.

Good luck! Keep practicing and trust yourself!
